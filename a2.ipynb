    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False. The output <class 'bool'> indicates the variable is a boolean data type.The keywords True and False must have an Upper Case first letter. Using a lowercase true returns an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. The three different types of boolean operators are: \n",
    "     1) AND\n",
    "     2) OR\n",
    "     3) NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. list of each boolean operater's truth table:\n",
    "  True and True is True.\n",
    "  True and False is False.\n",
    "  False and True is False.\n",
    "  False and False is False.\n",
    "  True or True is True.\n",
    "  True or False is True.\n",

    "5. What are the six comparison operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. The six comparison operators are: <, >, ==, <=, >= and !=\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. Assignment operators is used for assigning the value to a variable. Equals to used for comparing two values, it returns 1 if both the values are equal otherwise returns 0.\n",
    "In expression,\n",
    "     a = 12\n",
    "we used assignment operators to assign value to variable named a.\n",
    "while in expression,\n",
    "     12==13\n",
    "we compare to  values by using equal to operator.      \n",

    "  spam = 0\n",
    "  if spam == 10:\n",
    "  print('eggs')\n",
    "  if spam > 5:\n",

    "  print('ham')\n",
    "  print('spam')\n",

    "9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. CTRL + C\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. Break leaves the loop completely and executes the statements after the loop whereas Continue leaves the current iteration and executes with the next value in the loop. break completely exits the loop. continue skips the statements after the continue statement and keeps looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. They all do the same thing. The range(10) call ranges from 0 up to (but not including) 10, range(0,10) explicitly tells the loop to start at 0 , and range (0,10,1) explicitly tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration.\n",

    "     for i in range(1,11):\n",
