    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False. The output <class 'bool'> indicates the variable is a boolean data type.The keywords True and False must have an Upper Case first letter. Using a lowercase true returns an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. The three different types of boolean operators are: \n",
    "     1) AND\n",
    "     2) OR\n",
    "     3) NOT\n",

    "  True and True is True.\n",
    "  True and False is False.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. Assignment operators is used for assigning the value to a variable. Equals to used for comparing two values, it returns 1 if both the values are equal otherwise returns 0.\n",
    "In expression,\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans. Break leaves the loop completely and executes the statements after the loop whereas Continue leaves the current iteration and executes with the next value in the loop. break completely exits the loop. continue skips the statements after the continue statement and keeps looping.\n",
